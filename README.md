# Gulp, Tailwindcss, Nunjucks Boilerplate
Quickly get started with Tailwind and Nunjucks using Browserify and Gulp. Yeah, yet another one I'm using in my projects, feel free to use, modify :)

However, Nunjucks can be replaced with Twig or Jinja2.

## Boilerplate advantages:
- TailwindCSS framework's features
- Nunjucks template engine
- CSS purge that minifies project's bundle size
- Autoprefixer
- Project builder
- Development web-server (localhost:3000) 
- Browser auto-reload upon save

## How to use

Clone the repo:
`git clone git@github.com:rensite/GulpTailwind.git`

Install packages:

`yarn` or `npm`


Start development server and live reload:

`yarn dev` or `npm run dev`


Build the project:

`yarn build` or `npm run build`
